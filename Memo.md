***This short memo is aimed to address the archived Philosophy.md and the narrative control for this project.

While I was in my undergrad, I deliberately placed myself in adversarial ideological environments. I attended meetings, mostly seminar style, hosted by Republicans, Democrats and Libertarians regularly, along with cultural, religious and political events hosted by Hillel and Chabad on the weekly basis for 4 years. In those meetings, I didnâ€™t just encounter students of different ideologies, but the whole diasporas and immigrant stories: people with public service and security background, journalists, and activists who move across countries. Over time, that immersion taught me to treat ideological landmines like street signs instead of traps and navigate around them instinctively. The way I bypass landmines in contemporary politics and the narrative control overall is not performance or coaching, but muscle memory from living in contested multicultural spaces where words could be interpreted differently depending on who was listening.
